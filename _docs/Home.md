# Megaport Terraform Provider

The `terraform-provider-megaport` or Megaport Terraform Provider lets you create and manage 
Megaport's product and services using the [Megaport API](https://dev.megaport.com).

This provides an opportunity for true multi-cloud hybrid environments supported by Megaport's Software 
Defined Network (SDN). Using the Terraform provider, you can create and manage Ports, Virtual Cross 
Connects (VXCs), Megaport Cloud Routers (MCRs), and Partner VXCs.

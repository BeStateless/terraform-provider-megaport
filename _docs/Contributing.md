## Getting Started

Prior to working on new code, review the [Open Issues](../issues). Check whether your issue has already been raised, and consider working on an issue with votes or clear demand.

If you don't see an open issue for your need, open one and let others know what you are working on. Avoid lengthy or complex changes that rewrite the repository or introduce breaking changes. Straightforward pull requests based on discussion or ideas and Megaport feedback are the most likely to be accepted. 

Megaport is under no obligation to accept any pull requests or to accept them in full. You are free to fork and modify the code for your own use as long is it is published under the MPL-2.0 License.

## Priorities

The Megaport Terraform Provider is not part of the official Megaport product and is not supported through the usual product support channels. Megaport will work on the repository as it fits within other internal activities.

Issues will be tracked for their source and type.

 - Priority will be given to issues and bugs within the existing feature set.
 - Development requests may receive a response on the issue boards. Some features cannot be discussed until after their official launch.
 - Usage support requests will get limited responses. The tool is not part of the paid product and support is limited.

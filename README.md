# Overview
# Megaport Terraform Provider
---

The `terraform-provider-megaport` or Megaport Terraform Provider lets you create and manage
Megaport's product and services using the [Megaport API](https://dev.megaport.com).

This provides an opportunity for true multi-cloud hybrid environments supported by Megaport's Software
Defined Network (SDN). Using the Terraform provider, you can create and manage Ports,
Virtual Cross Connects (VXCs), Megaport Cloud Routers (MCRs), and Partner VXCs
(for full list see [Resources](../../wiki/Resources_Overview)).

Before beginning, please read the [Essentials Wiki Page](../../wiki/Home#Essentials)

The Megaport Terraform Provider is released as a tool for use with the Megaport API. It does not constitute
any part of the official paid product and is not eligible for support via the customer channels.

**Important:** The usage of the Megaport Terraform Provider constitutes your acceptance of the terms available
in the Megaport [Acceptable Use Policy](https://www.megaport.com/legal/acceptable-use-policy/) and
[Global Services Agreement](https://www.megaport.com/legal/global-services-agreement/).
